      <h2>"Ah, la Belgique!"</h2>
      <p>
        We know Belgium is said to be the ‘cockpit’ of Europe, and by cockpit I meant the pit where cock fights happen and not the pilot’s area of the plane. Belgium is so called because it has been the site of more European battles than any other country. The country lies on the road to many other countries, so it is between A and B, C and D, and so many more. Nobody really wanted Belgium, but, since it was in between, it became the battleground for a lot of countries on its either sides. It has been the ground for countless battles – Oudenarde, Ramillies, Fontenoy, Fleurus, Jemmapes, Ligny, Quatre Bras, Waterloo, and so, so many more.

      <h2>History of waffles</h2>
      <p>
        But we also know that Belgium is known for its waffles. Belgian waffles, and I already can feel the aroma of fresh, hot waffles drift by. Belgium has indeed gifted the world quite a few culinary delights – waffles to name one, and then there’s chocolates, crisp fries, well crafted beers, finest chocolates…

      <h2>So tasty</h2>
      <p>
        Food is but more than just sustenance, I believe. We have, over the years, grown to have food for pleasure, going beyond the purpose of simple sustenance. But, I believe, food could also be a significant symbol of culture. Subsistence patterns in a particular geographical area and the methods of acquiring and cooking food say a lot about the settlement patterns, the available resources, the beliefs and customs about a place. Food is indeed an important part of the culture of a geographical space.
